# Stock-Prdiction-and-Forecasting
Developed and implemented a time series prediction model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to forecast stock prices. Leveraged historical data to train the model, which was optimized for accuracy through data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation. The model was validated on unseen test data, demonstrating strong predictive performance. Key features included handling sequential data, reshaping input sequences, and plotting predicted versus actual stock prices to visually assess the modelâ€™s accuracy. This project showcased advanced skills in Python, TensorFlow, and data visualization with Matplotlib, as well as proficiency in machine learning concepts like overfitting, underfitting, and model evaluation metrics.
